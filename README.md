after creating the repository i added a new file README.md
on the command prompt i used the command "cd PLPBASICASSIGNMENT" to navigate to the folder i just created
on that folder i created a file hello.txt
i used git add to stage it
then git commit-m "my first commit to commit it"
finnaly git push -u origin to push it
